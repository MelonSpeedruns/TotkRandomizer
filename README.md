# TOTK Randomizer Mod

Just a Randomizer mod I've been working on since TOTK released, following the code and idea of my BOTW one.

## Quick start

Head over to the [Actions](https://github.com/MelonSpeedruns/TotkRandomizer/actions) section and download the latest artifact `randomizer.zip` file. Run it and configure it. Once the randomization process starts, it will create a new `romfs` folder next to the application. Simply install that `romfs` folder just like you would any other mod!

The randomizer works on a real Nintendo Switch console, Ryujinx and Yuzu.

If the app doesn't launch for you when double clicking it, then you might be missing the latest [.NET Desktop Runtime 7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-7.0.8-windows-x64-installer)

Here's what's randomized with the latest version of the Randomizer:
